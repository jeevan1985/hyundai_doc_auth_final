#      BULLETPROOF, DOCUMENTED, & COMPLIANT DOCKER ENTRYPOINT SCRIPT
# ==============================================================================
#
# This script is the single entrypoint for the application container. It is
# designed to be secure, robust, and resilient for production environments. It
# has been heavily commented to be understandable by users of all skill levels.
#
# It is responsible for four key tasks:
#
#   1. RESILIENCE (WAITING FOR DEPENDENCIES): It intelligently pauses execution
#      to wait for critical services (like a database) to be online before
#      the application starts. This prevents common startup crashes.
#
#   2. DYNAMIC CONFIGURATION (using SED): It uses the standard 'sed' utility
#      to modify configuration files based on environment variables. This
#      avoids dependencies on third-party tools like 'yq'.
#
#   3. IMMUTABILITY (COPY-ON-WRITE): It handles read-only configuration by
#      copying the source configs to a writable location inside the container
#      before modifying them. This is a critical security best practice.
#
#   4. PROCESS LAUNCHING (EXEC): It determines which application component to
#      run and uses 'exec' to correctly launch it as the main container
#      process, ensuring proper shutdown signals are received.
#
# It is assumed that the dependency 'nc' (netcat) is provided by the Docker image.

#                      SECTION 1: SCRIPT CONFIGURATION
# ==============================================================================

# --- Fail-Fast Behavior ---
# These settings are critical for creating reliable scripts.
#
# 'set -e': This command ensures that the script will exit immediately if any
#           command fails (returns a non-zero exit code). Without this, the
#           script might continue in a broken state.
#
# 'set -u': This command treats unset or unbound variables as an error and
#           causes the script to exit immediately. This is a great safety net
#           to catch typos in environment variable names. For example, if you
#           typed 'POSTGRES_PASWORD' instead of 'POSTGRES_PASSWORD', this
#           setting would cause the script to fail instantly.
set -eu

# --- Path Constants ---
# We define paths as variables for clarity, easy maintenance, and to avoid
# repeating magic strings throughout the script.
#
# SOURCE_CONFIG_DIR:   The path to the original, read-only configuration
#                      directory mounted into the container.
SOURCE_CONFIG_DIR="configs"
# WRITABLE_CONFIG_DIR: A temporary, writable directory inside the container's
#                      filesystem where we will place the modified configs.
WRITABLE_CONFIG_DIR="/tmp/runtime_configs"

# --- Terminal Color Constants ---
# These variables hold ANSI escape codes for adding color to the log output.
# This dramatically improves the readability of Docker logs.
C_BLUE='\033[94m'
C_GREEN='\033[92m'
C_YELLOW='\033[93m'
C_RED='\033[91m'
C_BOLD='\033[1m'
C_RESET='\033[0m' # This special code resets all text formatting.


# ==============================================================================
#                      SECTION 2: HELPER FUNCTIONS
# ==============================================================================
# This section contains functions that handle the dynamic configuration logic.
# Encapsulating logic in functions makes the main execution section clean and readable.

# --- Function: wait_for_service ---
# This function improves the resilience of the application stack. It pauses the
# script until a specific network service (like a database) is ready to accept
# connections, preventing the main application from crashing on startup.
#
# Usage: wait_for_service "Service Name" "hostname" "port"
wait_for_service() {
    local service_name="$1"
    local host="$2"
    local port="$3"

    # --- NOTE: This message is now slightly different to indicate the service is already known to be active. ---
    echo -e "${C_YELLOW}üü° $service_name is active. Waiting for it to become fully ready at $host:$port...${C_RESET}"

    # This is the wait loop. It uses 'nc' (netcat) to check the port.
    #
    # Command Breakdown:
    #   'while ! ...': The '!' inverts the result. The loop will continue as long
    #                  as the 'nc' command FAILS (i.e., the port is not open).
    #   'nc':          Netcat, a utility for network connections.
    #   '-z':          The "zero-I/O" or "scanning" mode. 'nc' will just check if
    #                  the port is open without sending any data, and then exit.
    while ! nc -z "$host" "$port"; do
        # If the check fails, print a message and wait for 2 seconds before trying again.
        echo "   ... still waiting"
        sleep 2
    done

    echo -e "${C_GREEN}‚úÖ $service_name is up and ready!${C_RESET}"
}

# --- Function: prepare_writable_configs ---
# This function implements the "copy-on-write" security best practice. It copies
# configuration files from a potentially read-only source (mounted from the
# host) to a temporary, writable destination inside the container. All subsequent
# modifications are made to these copies.
prepare_writable_configs() {
    # Step 1: Check if the source directory actually exists.

    #   '-d':         A test operator that returns true if the path exists
    #                 and is a Directory.

        exit 1
    fi

    # Step 2: Create the writable directory inside the container.
    #
    # Command Breakdown:
    #   'mkdir -p': The '-p' (parent) flag is important; it creates parent
    #               directories as needed and does not throw an error if the
    #               directory already exists. This makes the script re-runnable.

# --- Function: configure_qdrant ---

# While powerful, using 'sed' on structured files like YAML is less robust than
# a dedicated parser. This approach is used to avoid third-party dependencies.

        #                  the script from hanging indefinitely.
        #   '>/dev/null':  Redirects standard output (like success messages) to nowhere,
